# CLAUDE.md — PKNCA Documentation Book

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What This Is

A Quarto book documenting the [PKNCA](https://github.com/humanpred/pknca) R package (≥ 0.12.2).
Every function, option, and parameter is covered with runnable examples verified against live PKNCA output.

**Book repo (current):** https://github.com/TeunP/PKNCA.doc  
**Rendered book (current):** https://teunp.github.io/PKNCA.doc/  
**Book repo (intended):** https://github.com/humanpred/pknca-book  
**Rendered book (intended):** https://humanpred.github.io/pknca-book/  
**pkgdown site:** https://humanpred.github.io/pknca/

## How to Render

```bash
quarto render        # full build → output in _book/
quarto preview       # live preview with auto-reload
```

```r
# Install dependencies (once)
remotes::install_github("humanpred/pknca")  # >= 0.12.2 required
install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "conflicted", "testthat", "visNetwork"))
```

## Project Structure

```
_quarto.yml              # book config: title, author, chapters, site-url, navbar
index.qmd                # introduction + What's new per version
user/                    # 19 User Guide chapters
dev/                     # 2 Developer Reference chapters
validate.R               # numeric self-check of key documented examples (Rscript validate.R; exits 1 on failure)
.github/workflows/book.yml  # CI: runs validate.R, renders, deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main
_book/                   # rendered output (gitignored)
```

## Conventions

- **Datasets:** `datasets::Theoph` (extravascular) and `datasets::Indometh` (intravascular)
- **PKNCA version:** ≥ 0.12.2
- **Code chunks:** `eval: true` — every chunk must run without error
- **No `suppressWarnings()`** hiding real issues — fix root causes
- **Each page is self-contained:** load packages at the top of every `.qmd`
- **New features** are tagged with `(≥ X.Y.Z)` to indicate the minimum version

## Adding or Updating Content

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full update workflow, including how to find what changed in a new PKNCA release, write and test examples, identify which pages to update, and verify the build.

- New user topics → add a `.qmd` to `user/` and register it in `_quarto.yml`
- New dev topics → add a `.qmd` to `dev/` and register it in `_quarto.yml`
- Always run `quarto render` after changes and check the console for errors
- Every chapter must end with a `:::callout-note` footer linking new functions to `https://humanpred.github.io/pknca/reference/<function>.html` — add links when introducing functions not yet in the footer
- The live URL depends on where the repo is hosted — `teunp.github.io/PKNCA.doc/` (current), `humanpred.github.io/pknca-book/` (intended), or a custom domain. If the URL changes, update `site-url` in `_quarto.yml`
- When reviewing code correctness, read every code chunk in full and check for: wrong input shapes (e.g. multi-subject vectors passed to single-subject functions), out-of-scope variables (referenced before creation or from a different chunk), bad column references, and invalid function arguments. Then render the book locally (`quarto render`) and inspect the console output for warnings and errors — static review alone is not sufficient
- When updating the CI workflow's package list, audit all chapters at once rather than fixing one missing package per run:
  ```bash
  grep -rh "^library(" user/ dev/ index.qmd | sort -u
  ```
